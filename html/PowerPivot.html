<p>
    PowerPivot is a free addin for Excel, which Microsoft based on SQL Server Analysis Services and it
    provides a
    different way of working with Excel.
</p>

<p>
    The conventional way to work with Excel is to import data and then manipulate it. Some formulas use the
    data and
    then the formulas are copied down the spreadsheet. The resulting spreadsheet of data is then summarized
    in pivot
    tables.
</p>

<p>
    PowerPivot makes it possible to write formulas using column names. Once you have entered a formula,
    PowerPivot
    applies the formula to the whole column. PowerPivot then allows you to name the column.
</p>

<p>
    The newly named calculated column is then available to use by name in other calculated columns.
</p>

<p>
    In this example, I will summarize some sales data by year and product type. The example will demonstrate
    how to
    define measures to calculate the percentage of sales by product.
</p>

<p>
    To open the Pivot Power window click on Create Linked table this loads your data into named columns.
    PowerPivot
    names the table in the window Sales Table by taking the name from the table in the worksheet.
</p>

<p>
    Now we can calculate sales by multiplying units by price. So you can click on a cell or tab across to a
    cell in
    the empty column headed Add Column. In the new column you can type a formula, in a manner similar to
    traditional
    excel. When you press the left square bracket excel will list the available fields. The formula for
    sales is a
    simple multiplication.
</p>

<p class="code">
    =[Price]*[Units]
</p>
<img src="../images/PowerPivot/020 Sales Column.png" class="centre image-wide10">

<p>
    This formula is a column formula and PowerPivot will apply it to the whole column when you press return.
    Right
    click on the column header and rename the column to Sales.
</p>

<p>
    The formula for commission is a simple division.
</p>

<p class="code">
    =[Sales]*[Commission Rate]/100
</p>

<p>
    It is also possible to use aggregate functions for a whole column. To calculate total commission tab to
    the next
    empty column headed Add Column and use the Sum() function.
</p>

<p class="code">
    =Sum([Commission])
</p>

<p>
    Date functions are similar to the normal excel functions, the number of the sales month and the sales
    year are
    simple to extract from the Sales Date field.
</p>

<p class="code">
    =Month([Sales Date])
    =Year([Sales Date])
</p>

<p>
    Now on the home tab of the PowerPivot menu you can click Pivot Table to insert a pivot table in a
    spreadsheet as
    you normally would.
</p>

<p>
    When you click on the inserted pivot table, the PowerPivot Field List should appear on the right hand
    side of
    your sheet.
</p>

<p>
    Here you can drag the Sales field down to Values and Excel will display the total sales. If you drag the
    Year
    field down to Row Labels Excel will break down the sales by year. If you drag Product down to the row
    labels,
    Excel will break down sales by Product.
</p>

<p>
    So far, the pivot table is just like a normal pivot table except it used calculated columns but what is
    new in
    PowerPivot is the ability to create new measures.
</p>

<p>
    To define a measure to summarize the sales days right click on the Sales Table in the field list, and
    select Add
    New Measure. Then type a name in the Measure name text box, for this example I called the measure Sales
    Days. To
    enter the formula, tab down to the Formula text box and type the formula.
</p>

<p class="code">
    =DISTINCTCOUNT('Sales Table'[Sales Date])
</p>

<p>
    Here DistinctCount() just returns the count of rows where [Sales Date] is different. In the
    demonstration data,
    there was only one day where there was more than one sale, so DisinctCount() returns 39 rows.
</p>

<p>
    The number of transactions is simply the count of the records in the Sales Table.
</p>

<p class="code">
    =COUNTROWS('Sales Table')
</p>

<p>
    After you have created measures, you can reuse them in further measures and the following examples will
    demonstrate this.
</p>

<p>
    To calculate the product sales as percentages we can create some measures.
</p>

<p>
    The All Sales the formula uses Calculate.
</p>

<p class="code">
    =CALCULATE( Sum( 'Sales Table'[Sales] ), ALL('Sales Table'[Product]))
</p>

<p>
    Calculate applies the formula in this case Sum(), to the filter, in this case All(). So here, we get the
    total
    sales for all the rows in the Sales Table including rows not selected in the pivot.
</p>

<p>
    We can now use the [All Sales] measure to calculate the product sales as percentages in a new measure
    Sales
    Product as %.
</p>

<p class="code">
    =Sum( 'Sales Table'[Sales] ) / [All Sales]
</p>

<p>
    This gives us the sales of a product as a percentage of all sales but we might want to see the
    percentage of
    sales of just the products we have selected in a Product slicer.
</p>

<p>
    To calculate the sales of the products selected in the Product slicer we can use the filter function
    ALLSELECTED, which only returns the rows, summarized in the pivot table rather than the whole table. So
    add a
    new measure Sales Selected Products, which uses Calculate to apply the function Sum() to Sales, for just
    the
    Product categories which are selected in the pivot table.
</p>

<p class="code">
    =CALCULATE(sum('Sales Table'[Sales]),ALLSELECTED('Sales Table'[Product]))
</p>
<img src="../images/PowerPivot/200 Selected Product Measure.png" class="centre image-wide10">

<p>
    Now we can reuse this Sales Selected Products in a new measure Sales Selected Products as %.
</p>

<p class="code">
    =Sum('Sales Table'[Sales]) / 'Sales Table'[Sales Selected Products]
</p>

<p>
    So, using PowerPivot we have summarized and broken down the sales table data and only used conventional
    Excel to
    insert the PowerPivot table.
